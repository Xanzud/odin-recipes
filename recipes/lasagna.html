    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../recipeImgs/lasagna.jpg" alt="Image of finished lasagna dish." width="500" height="500">
    <p>To me, there is nothing that invokes childhood memories quite like the lasagna my mom used to make.
        Every time I take a bite of this dish, it takes me back to the kitchen table, where I and my sisters
        would be wating eagerly for dad to come home from work, while my mom was putting the finishing touches on
        todays dinner.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe is my attempt at recreating that same feeling. While it's not quite the same, it is my hope that
        this dish can one day bring just a fraction of the warm feeling I have learnt to associate with lasagna to all of you. 
    </p>
