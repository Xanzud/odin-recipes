    <h1>Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <img src="../recipeImgs/buttered_noodles.jpg" alt="Image of finished buttered noodles dish." width="500" height="500">
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either<br>
        as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.<br>
        Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick<br>
        and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice<br>
        could be added to amp up the flavor.<br>
        It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to<br>
        make it.
